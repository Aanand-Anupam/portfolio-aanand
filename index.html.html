<section><i><u>Before class 9th</u></i><br>
Upto class 8th i was a very average student in terms of knowledge but still <br>i was able to come in the top 3 student as our class itself was of 10 people only .</section>
<section><i><u>After class 9th</u></i><br>
In 9th i along with my younger sister moved to DAV public school,Kanti.<br>
And that was a different experince we got very competitive enviroment.<br>
A enviroment where students are really hardworking.<br>
That was the starting of a new phase of life in which i learned how to learn. </section>
